      #### When I get rich I’ll start to collect French impressionist art. I’ll
      put my Monet where my mouth is.


      **My friend said my hair looked like a work of art. Haystacks.**


      I bought a French impressionist painting, but my cat scratched it.  So I'm now selling it on as a clawed Monet.


      **A burglar walks into an art show. He shouts, "Give me all your Manet!”**


      Renoir and Monet walked straight into a hat shop.  You would have thought one of them would have seen it.


      **I ear a new Van Gogh has been discovered.**


      Degas said that he stays alert because he paints ballet dancers.  They keep him on his toes.


      <mark>**I went to the toilet in an art gallery. It wasn’t long before I needed to Gauguin.**</mark>


      The problem with painting seascapes en plein air is that the weather always changes. That’s why you have to get out there and seas the day!


      **Cézanne decided to trace his family tree.  He struggled with drawing.**


      Eventually Degas gave up on his photography hobby.  He kept losing focus.


      **My son is trying to change my will so he can inherit my Impressionist collection. He’s a man after my own art.**


      Two Impressionists had a contest over who was the better painter. It ended in a draw.


      **My friend bought a copy of Manet’s L’Dejuner sur l’herb. It was in mint condition.**


      Caillebotte made the mistake of insulting the paintbrush seller.  He went very bristly.


      **Unlike the rest of the Impressionists, Durand-Ruel did not take much interest in Cezanne’s self-portraits.  He didn't paint a good picture of himself.**


      Pissarro went to buy new paintbrushes, on the way home he couldn’t sit still.  He was bristling with excitement.


      **After he was ridiculed for his paintings of cafes in Paris, Degas decided to take a leave of absinthe.**


      Monet enjoyed painting in his garden, especially among the herbs. Unfortunately he often ran out of thyme to finish them.


      **Monet often wrote to Caillebotte asking for tips about his plants.  He gave him sage advice.**


      I heard Manet fell in love with a fencing instructor. She pierced his art.


      **Sometimes my artist friends get annoyed at me because I give such long descriptions but I’m just painting a picture.**


      <mark>I’ve been learning to read with a book on impressionism. The Cassatt on the mat.</mark>


      **I have the impression that the Impressionists’ Impressionist impressions are impressive.**


      The doctors say my friend is ill. She’s turning into an Impressionist portrait. I think she’s a picture of health.


      **I once knew an Impressionist curator who was also a violinist. I didn’t like him much, he was always playing to the gallery.**

Renoir!” says the rest of the group, “We can’t give in to pier pressure!”**
