      ### Monet painted ‘Impression, Sunrise’ from the window of the Hôtel de
      l’Amirauté in 1873 (though he  mis-dated it '72).


      The window overlooked the port of Le Havre, giving Monet a perfect view to paint the harbour at sunrise. Monet probably painted the picture in one sitting.  


      #### The scene


      The eye is immediately drawn to the rising sun and the reflection it casts in the water.  Most viewers then notice the central rowing boat and a secondary rowing boat in the fore- and mid-ground: they seem to be travelling slowly, as if the oarsman is waking up with the sun.

      Closer inspection reveals: 


      * A third rowing boat (at 10 o'clock from the second) (RED)

      * The masts of anchored clipper ships (behind the second rowing boat), one of which can also be seen reflected in the water (YELLOW).

      * Factory chimneys puffing out smoke (next to the clippers) (GREEN).

      * Cranes and derricks on the dock, ready to unload ships (BLUE).

      * The impression that the Harbour is shrouded in a light mist.

      #### Impressionist traits


      Unsurprisingly, Impression: Sunrise displays a number of traits of the impressionist movement.


      **First**, and most importantly, Monet was not trying to produce a photographic reproduction of the port.  Instead, he sought to capture his impression of the scene.  This can be seen in a number of ways:


      * The painting was almost certainly produced in one sitting, as Monet raced to capture the rising sun.  This can be seen from the very broad brush strokes at the top of the canvas.

      * Monet did not paint everything that he saw.  For example, 


      **Secondly**, this is a modern scene of a recently industrialised port.  The painting of modern life was key to the impressionists, who rejected the historical, allegorical and religious scenes favoured by the conservative art establishment.  


      **Thirdly**, the painting uses colour in a bold fashion -- the eye is immediately drawn to the circular sun.  And, like most of the impressionists, Monet makes sparing use of black (to emphasise the central rowing boat).

    text: >-
      ### Impression: Sunrise was influenced by the English landscapist JMW
      Turner and by Japanese prints.


      #### JMW Turner's inspiration


      It is thought that much of the inspiration for the work was drawn from Joseph Mallord William Turner’s ‘The Scarlet Sunset’ from 1839-40. Monet would have seen the painting whilst in exile in London fleeing from the Franco Prussian War. 


      Like ‘Impression, Sunrise’, Turner’s painting features a limited range of colours and strong colour contrasts to create a hazy, striking painting.


      ![Monet's Impression Sunrise](/assets/claude-monet-impression-sunrise.jpg "Monet's Impression Sunrise")


      ![JMW Turner's the Scarlet Sunset (1839-40)](/assets/jmw-turner-scarlet-sunset.jpg "JMW Turner's the Scarlet Sunset (1839-40)")


      Turner often painted on blue paper during this period of his career and it is this backing that produced the blue tones seen in ‘The Scarlet Sunset’. Like the Impressionists, he also used extremely opaque pigments to create the colour effects in his later works. 


      Monet retrospectively denied any influence from Turner on his work: 


      > “Once I liked Turner very much, but now I like him less - he did not lay out his colour carefully enough, and he used too much of it. I have studied him well.” This quote was attributed to Monet by the French art dealer René Gimpel in 1918.


      #### Japonisme


      For this painting, Monet also drew inspiration from ‘Japonisme’, which had been an important cultural influence in France and Europe since the late 1850s. The arrival of Japanese prints and items in France had led many artists to begin incorporating Japanese themes and techniques into their artworks. 


      It is thought that Monet began collecting Japanese woodblock prints as early as 1871 during a trip to Holland.  By the time of his death, he had an extensive collection of works by Utamaro, Hokusai, and Hiroshige.


      The influence of Japanese prints on Impression: Sunrise is evident from certain techniques used in the painting such as the depiction of moving water, the position of the boats and the blending of the land and the sky.


      Art historians have linked Monet’s painting to several Japanese prints with similar details. These include ‘Meisho Edo Hyakkei-Shiba Ura no Fukei’ a 1856 print by Hiroshige, which has parallels in the angle of the three boats shown in the foreground of the work. Hiroshige’s 1858 work ‘Mouth of the Aji River in Settsu Province, from the series Wrestling Matches between Mountains and Seas’ also closely resembles the composition of Monet’s ‘Impression, Sunrise’.


      ![Moonlight on the Yodo River by Hokusai](/assets/moonlight-on-the-yodo-river-hokusai.jpg "Moonlight on the Yodo River by Hokusai")


      Meanwhile, a print by Hokusai from 1833 titled ‘Moonlight on the Yodo River’ from his ‘Snow, Moon and Flowers’ series is thought to have been a source of inspiration for Monet, especially in the method of blending the sky and the land so that it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. The moon in Hokusai’s print is also very similar to Monet’s sun. 


      Monet’s quick, short brushstrokes are reminiscent of Japanese prints which tended to favour hard vertical and diagonal lines. He deliberately painted with a lack of detail, especially when creating the backgrounds for his works and this could also have been borrowed from Japanese prints, such as the works of Utamaro.


      #### Monet's own contribution


      Despite these varied influences, Monet also made something that was entirely his own. As the scholar John House describes, 


      > “Japanese art helped him to see the pictorial possibilities of such forms and suggested ways of framing them on the canvas, but the final structure of each picture is the result of his direct confrontation with the motif.”


      Monet’s inclusion of industrial elements in ‘Impression, Sunrise’ singled him out as a painter of modern life. He chose to show the landscape as it had been shaped by recent events and construction, rather than erasing these structures from the scene. In this way, Monet’s painting does not reference a lost past, it is rooted firmly in the present.

    text: >-
      ### When the painting was stolen in 1985, along with eight other
      paintings, the total works were given a valuation of approximately $12.5
      million. 


      However, since then the price for Impressionist paintings, and especially works by Monet, have increased significantly.


      In May 2019, one painting from his ‘Haystacks’ series from 1890 sold for a staggering $110.7 million at a Sotheby’s auction, pushing the price of the painting 44 times higher than what the seller had originally purchased it for. This shows the dramatic rise in value of Impressionist paintings in recent years. 


      This can also be seen by the fact that Cezanne's Card Players was sold for a world-record price of $259 million in February 2002.  


      Given the fame and importance of *Impression: Sunrise*, we consider that it would sell for c. $250-350 million.

      ### ‘Impression, Sunrise’ was displayed to the public at the First
      Impressionist Exhibition in the spring of 1874. 


      In contrast to the official Paris Salon, organised by a strict panel of conservative judges, the Impressionist exhibition allowed the artists to exhibit the kind of work they wanted to create. 


      At this time, the group was called the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptures, Printmakers etc. and the key members included Monet, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Auguste Renoir, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas and Jean Frèdéric Bazille. 


      #### Organisation


      The group was organised fairly democratically and a number of protocols were put in place to make sure that the exhibition would be fair. Instead of hanging the paintings on multiple levels, for instance, with younger and lesser known artists at the very top, the Impressionists agreed to hang their work in two rows. The smaller pictures went below and the larger works went on top.


      This refreshing, daring alternative to the Salon drew a lot of attention from the press. It was generally agreed that the Salon had become too restrictive with the 1872 event failing to recognise current events. In the words of Jules Castagnary, for instance, 


      > “Coming after the war and the terrible events of the past year, the show should have had an original and gripping make-up. Instead, it is absolutely devoid of character. \[…] You walk around there not knowing what country you're in or what year it is. It doesn't have the soul or life of France.”


      #### Negative reception


      However, despite the demand for something new and different, the overall reception to the Impressionists’ independent exhibition was not positive. Many of the artworks were met with derision. In response to the exhibition, the art critic Louis Leroy described the paintings on display as 


      > “hostile to good artistic manner, to devotion to form, and respect for the masters.” 


      Unfortunately, Leroy was not the only critic to ridicule the First Impressionist exhibition. The critic for La Patrie for instance described how, 


      > “Seeing the lot, you burst out laughing but with the last ones you finally get angry and you're sorry you did not give the franc you paid to get in to some beggar.”


      #### The term 'Impressionism'


      Looking to capitalise on the confusion and negative publicity the exhibition had prompted, Leroy borrowed from the title of Monet’s painting, ‘Impression, Sunrise’ and repeatedly described the works as “impressions”. What Leroy meant by this term was that the works appeared unfinished and unfit for the standards held by Academic painting. 


      He used the word “Impression” to suggest that the artists were lazy and lacked talent, comparing Pissarro’s ‘Hoarfrost’ painting to paint scraped from a dirty palette. His description of ‘Impression, Sunrise’ was no more complimentary, describing the work as “less finished than wallpaper in an embryonic state”. 


      Over the following years, the group chose to adopt “Impression” as a term to describe themselves and their work, becoming known collectively as the “Impressionists”. From this base, they developed the unique style and techniques that gathered them both fame and notoriety.


      #### Positive reviews


      On the other hand, not all of the reviews of the exhibition were as insulting. Emile d’Hervilly wrote about the show for Le Rappel, describing Monet’s work as possessing “infinite grace and spirit.” He also praised the show as a whole, praising the “fresh” and “gripping” works whose “generous exaggerations are even charming and consoling when one thinks of the nauseating banalities of the academic routine.”


      Armand Silvestre also offered his support describing Monet as “the cleverest and the most daring” of the artists featured in the exhibition. He believed, 


      > “You need special eyes in order to be sensitive to the subtlety of their tonal relations, which constitute their honor and merit”. 


      At the same time however, he was unsure of their pursuit of the ‘impression' and the suggestion that everything in the world is beautiful enough to be worth painting.


      In all the reviews of the exhibition, ‘Impression, Sunrise’ was only referenced five times. Overall it failed to gain the attention that other paintings did and was far behind the most talked about of Monet’s works. Ernest Chesnau, for instance, simply described that he stopped in front of the painting. He does not offer any further description or opinion on the piece.

      ### At the time when ‘Impression, Sunrise’ was painted, Monet had recently
      returned to France from Holland. 


      #### London to Holland to Le Havre


      He had made the journey to Holland from London where he had sheltered during the Franco Prussian War. Writing to Pissarro in June 1871, he described how, 


      > “We’ve been completely without news of Paris since we left London, it’s impossible to get a French newspaper here.”


      The sights that greeted him on his return must have been quite shocking. Travelling to Argenteuil from Paris, for instance, he would have seen the destruction left over from the war. Argenteuil had been occupied by the Prussian army and the railroad and highway bridges had been completely destroyed.


      #### Industrialisation


      During this period, Monet chose to paint images of industrialisation in France. These works included images of bridge-building, trains and other technological advancements. Whilst they gave Monet ample modern subjects to paint, they also proved to be fairly lucrative for the artist. In 1872, for instance, he successfully sold ‘The Highway Bridge’, ‘The Train’ and ‘The Path Through The Vineyards’, as well as a number of other works. 


      In total, Monet earned 12,000 francs from the sale of his paintings in 1872, a good income considering doctors or lawyers in Paris would earn around 9,000-10,000 francs at this time. In this context, ‘Impression, Sunrise’ would have been painted as much as a commercial decision as an artistic one. 


      #### Le Havre


      Le Havre was one of the busiest ports in France in the early 1870s and would have been a popular subject for newly wealthy industrialists and the growing middle class who had their roots in commerce. ‘Impression, Sunrise’ signified the strength and beauty of France as it recovered from war. It formed a patriotic statement that fitted with public demand at the time.


      In the words of Paul Tucker 


      > “The sense of renewal or of becoming is felt in the picture as a whole: in the sun's clear spherical penetration of the mist, in its dappled reflections which pull it forward, in the billowing smokestacks on the left and that side's contrast with the right”. As well as painting a sunrise, a typical subject for landscape painters, Monet also chose to capture some of hope and energy surging through France during the 1870s thanks to determined post-war efforts.  The result is that ‘Impression, Sunrise’ forms a “progressive, consummately beautiful scene, where man clearly has his place”.

### Claude Monet's *Impression: Sunrise*, painted in 1873 when Monet was 32, is one of the most famous and important impressionist works.

Exhibited by Monet at the 1874 first impressionist exhibition, the painting was panned by the critics.  One wrote:

> "wallpaper in its early stages is more finished by that".

The critics used the painting's name to coin the word impressionism, intended as an insult. But the term caught on and was adopted by the group we now call the impressionists.  

*Impression: Sunrise* displays a number of key features of the impressionist movement: **(i)** it was painted quickly, **(ii)** it uses broad, unblended brushstrokes and bold colours, and **(iii)** it depicts a modern scene.  

The painting is now held at the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris.  Its fame is increased by the fact it was stolen in a gunpoint raid on 27 October 1985 and was not recovered until it was traced to a Corsican apartment five years later.  

In terms of value, the painting was initially bought in 1874 for 1000 francs and sold again in 18xx for 281 francs.  Today, we estimate that it is worth $250-350 million.
