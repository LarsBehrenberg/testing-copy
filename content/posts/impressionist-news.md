      ### Covid-19 has dampened demand for impressionist work at auctions and
      delayed a number of exhibitions.  But it is not all bad news, as we
      explain below.


      #### July 2020


      The [US National Gallery of Art](https://www.nga.gov/index.html) in Washington re-opened on Monday 20 July, but requires face masks to be worn and social distancing.  It is the latest museum to re-open its doors following Covid shutdown.  Visitors can check out a [van Gogh](van-gogh-biography/) self-portrait, a version of Monet's Japanese Footbridge, Cezanne's The Peppermint Bottle and Manet's The Railway.  


      The Washington Post published a fascinating article on [Manet's The Dead Toreador](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/entertainment/edouard-manet-the-dead-toreador/) on 15 July 2020.  It includes the observation


      > Part of the reason Manet is regarded as the father of modernism is that his paintings uncovered fault lines that were fresh at the time but keep getting wider. “The Dead Toreador” is a fine example ... 


      The [Normandie Impressionniste 2020](https://www.normandie-impressionniste.fr/ "https\://www.normandie-impressionniste.fr/"), a festival of over 50 impressionist exhibitions, has now started and will run until 4 November 2020.  The exhibitions include Francois Depeaux, *The Man with 500 Paintings*, at the Rouen Fine Arts Museum featuring works by Monet, Renoir and Sisley.  The most famous painting on display is Monet's Rue St-Denis (pictured).  


      Museums are starting to re-open after Covid lockdown:


      * The Mississippi Museum of Art, for instance, welcomes members again from 1 July and the general public from 8 July (first responders and essential workers go free).  The Museum has also said that their *Van Gogh, Monet, Degas & Their Times* exhibition will re-open on 8 July (with its run extended until 10 January 2021. 

      * The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts' exhibition entitled Paris in the Days of Post-Impressionism opens on 4 July 2020.  Works by Monet, Morisot, Signac, Pissarro and Seurat are on display.

      * The Musee D'Orsay re-opened its doors on 28 June, but numbers are to be restricted to 3,000 per day and visitors are required to wear face masks.

      * London's museums re-opened on 4 July 2020, with the National Gallery offering priority access to members.  


      Meanwhile, Christie's has had to take severe costs cutting measures, merging its impressionism, modern and contemporary art departments into one.  And a battle regarding the Nazi-era sale of [Monet's Le Palais Ducal](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/heirs-battle-estate-over-usd30m-monet-painting-from-emden-collection-sold-during-nazi-era) (with an estimated value of $30 million) is due to be heard in the courts of New York in September 2020.  


      The town of Southbury Connecticut is hosting an online [Zoom talk on Claude Monet](https://www.southbury-ct.org/events-feed/?FeedID=5727) on 27 July 2020.  


      Finally, [Monet's Giverny](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/escape/article-8498821/Hunspach-Alsace-winner-beautiful-village-France-competition.html) has come in 13th in a poll of the most beautiful villages in France.  


      #### June 2020


      On 1 June 2020 the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is delivering an online course for children in grades 1-5 entitled [Exploring Impressionism: The Art of Claude Monet](https://mfa.org/event/distance-learning/exploring-impressionism-the-art-of-claude-monet?event=62431).


      Or take a [virtual tour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/french-impressionism-art-tour-at-the-national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc-tickets-109308235876?aff=erelexpmlt) of Washington's National Gallery of Art at 7pm on 26 June 2020 (tickets cost $15). 


      On 9 June 2020, London's National Gallery announced that it had purchased [The Drunkard, Zarauz](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/09/national-gallery-buys-dazzling-joaquin-sorolla-painting) by Joaquín Sorolla, using funds left by a private donation.  The acquisition follows the National Gallery's hugely successful Sorolla exhibition held before Covid-19 lockdown started.  


      Speaking of Covid-19, Claude Monet's gardens at Giverny have [re-opened](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-france-monet/locals-savour-monets-gardens-without-the-crowds-idUKKBN23G2HP).  Locals are delighted: they can appreciate the gardens without the usual crowds!


      Christie's is holding an [Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sale](https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/impressionist-modern-art-evening-sale) on **30 June**, but the title is a bit misleading.  The closest one gets to impressionism are works by Paul Signac and Pablo Picasso.


      #### May 2020


      On 18 May 2020, Sotheby's held its first [Impressionist & Modern Art Day Sale Online](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2020/impressionist-modern-art-day-sale-online).  The results for impressionist pieces often exceeded expectations.  Pissarro's Effect de Neige a Onsy sold for $560,000 (exceeding the top-end estimate of $350,000); Degas' Buste de Jeune Femme Presque Nue sold for $596,000 (estimate: $450,000); and Renoir's La Maison de la Poste sold for $200,000 (in the middle of its estimated range).  


      The UK's Guardian has produced this fun online [art quiz](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/15/how-do-we-know-monet-painted-this-outdoors-the-great-british-art-quiz), including a question about Claude Monet.


      The Foundation Monet has launched an [online tour](https://fondation-monet.com/visite-virtuelle/) of Monet's House in Giverny.  Explore Monet's bedroom, his yellow kitchen adorned with Japanese art, and his blue-tiled kitchen.  


      The house is also home to about 40 of Monet's works (including from the Rouen Cathedral, Haystacks, Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament and Venice series) as well as works by other artists (Cezanne in particular).  


      Unfortunately, there is no virtual tour of the gardens (though you can check out some videos on The Foundation Monet's [vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/fondationmonetgiverny)).  


      The Courtauld Institute is hosting a series of virtual mini-art festivals to help you get through lockdown.  [May 2020](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-courtauld-hour-art-in-isolation-tickets-103139410754) sees evenings devoted to Women Artists, the Future of Art History and Art and Wellbeing.


      The Shelbourne Museum in Vermont is also putting on daily [art-related activities](https://shelburnemuseum.org/museum-from-home/ten-two-four-break-challenge/).


      There's an online [auction of autographs](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/news/mao-marx-autographs-and-artifacts-offered-online-auction) and writings (you can bid until 13 May 2020), with lots including an 8-page letter written by Claude Monet to his second wife, Alice, in 1901.  It comments on the arrangements for Queen Victoria's funeral and Monet's meeting with writer Henry James.


      #### Jan-April 2020


      In February 2020, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts marked its 150th anniversary.  It selected 15 key works for the occasion, including one of Monet's Haystacks (or Grainstacks).


      The Louvre-Lens museum, in the north of Paris, is holding an exhibition entitled [Black Suns](https://www.louvrelens.fr/en/exhibition/noir/).  It explores artists' use of the colour black.  Edouard Manet, who unlike many of the impressionists loved using this colour, features heavily.  The exhibition runs until 25 January 2021.

      **1 September 2019.**  The Amsterdam Van Gogh Museum's exhibition entitled
      Van Gogh and Sunflowers comes to an end.  It explores Van Gogh's most
      famous motif, with 23 of the sunflowers on display.  


      **11 August 2019**.  The Tate Britain's exhibition entitled Van Gogh and Britain comes to an end; it explores Van Gogh's three-year stay in London in his early 20s, including the haunting Visitors Exercising (painted in 1890 but depicting the Newgate jail seen by Van Gogh decades earlier).  


      **19 May 2019**.  A luminous version of Monet's Haystacks sells at Christie's  New York for a record $97m ($110.7m with fees).


      **20 January 2019**.  The London National Gallery's exhibition entitled Courtauld Impressionists: from Manet to Cezanne comes to an end.  This show includes forty of the Courtauld gallery's most impressive masterpieces (which are able to be shown because the Courtauld is undergoing a major renovation project).  My favourite work on display is Renoir's La Loge (The Theatre Box).
