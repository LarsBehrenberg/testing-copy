      ### Covid-19 has dampened demand for impressionist work at auctions and
      delayed a number of exhibitions.  But it is not all bad news, as we
      explain below.


      #### July 2020


      Museums are starting to re-open after Covid lockdown:


      * The Mississippi Museum of Art, for instance, welcomes members again from 1 July and the general public from 8 July (first responders and essential workers go free).  The Museum has also said that their *Van Gogh, Monet, Degas & Their Times* exhibition will re-open on 8 July (with its run extended until 10 January 2021. 


      * The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts' exhibition entitled Paris in the Days of Post-Impressionism opens on 4 July 2020.  Works by Monet, Morisot, Signac, Pissarro and Seurat are on display.


      * The Musee D'Orsay re-opened its doors on 28 June, but numbers are to be restricted to 3,000 per day and visitors are required to wear face masks.


      * Meanwhile, London's museums are due to re-open on 4 July 2020.  


      Meanwhile, Christie's has had to take severe costs cutting measures, merging its impressionism, modern and contemporary art departments into one.  


      #### June 2020


      On 1 June 2020 the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is delivering an online course for children in grades 1-5 entitled [Exploring Impressionism: The Art of Claude Monet](https://mfa.org/event/distance-learning/exploring-impressionism-the-art-of-claude-monet?event=62431).


      Or take a [virtual tour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/french-impressionism-art-tour-at-the-national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc-tickets-109308235876?aff=erelexpmlt) of Washington's National Gallery of Art at 7pm on 26 June 2020 (tickets cost $15). 


      On 9 June 2020, London's National Gallery announced that it had purchased [The Drunkard, Zarauz](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/09/national-gallery-buys-dazzling-joaquin-sorolla-painting) by Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, using funds left by a private donation.  The acquisition follows the National Gallery's hugely successful Sorolla exhibition held before Covid-19 lockdown started.  


      Speaking of Covid-19, Claude Monet's gardens at Giverny have [re-opened](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-france-monet/locals-savour-monets-gardens-without-the-crowds-idUKKBN23G2HP).  Locals are delighted: they can appreciate the gardens without the usual crowds!


      Christie's is holding an [Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sale](https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/impressionist-modern-art-evening-sale) on **30 June**, but the title is a bit misleading.  The closest one gets to impressionism are works by Paul Signac and Pablo Picasso.


      #### May 2020


      On 18 May 2020, Sotheby's held its first [Impressionist & Modern Art Day Sale Online](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2020/impressionist-modern-art-day-sale-online).  The results for impressionist pieces often exceeded expectations.  Pissarro's Effect de Neige a Onsy sold for $560,000 (exceeding the top-end estimate of $350,000); Degas' Buste de Jeune Femme Presque Nue sold for $596,000 (estimate: $450,000); and Renoir's La Maison de la Poste sold for $200,000 (in the middle of its estimated range).  


      The UK's Guardian has produced this fun online [art quiz](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/15/how-do-we-know-monet-painted-this-outdoors-the-great-british-art-quiz), including a question about Claude Monet.


      The Foundation Monet has launched an [online tour](https://fondation-monet.com/visite-virtuelle/) of Monet's House in Giverny.  Explore Monet's bedroom, his yellow kitchen adorned with Japanese art, and his blue-tiled kitchen.  


      The house is also home to about 40 of Monet's works (including from the Rouen Cathedral, Haystacks, Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament and Venice series) as well as works by other artists (Cezanne in particular).  


      Unfortunately, there is no virtual tour of the gardens (though you can check out some videos on The Foundation Monet's [vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/fondationmonetgiverny)).  


      The Courtauld Institute is hosting a series of virtual mini-art festivals to help you get through lockdown.  [May 2020](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-courtauld-hour-art-in-isolation-tickets-103139410754) sees evenings devoted to Women Artists, the Future of Art History and Art and Wellbeing.


      The Shelbourne Museum in Vermont is also putting on daily [art-related activities](https://shelburnemuseum.org/museum-from-home/ten-two-four-break-challenge/).


      There's an online [auction of autographs](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/news/mao-marx-autographs-and-artifacts-offered-online-auction) and writings (you can bid until 13 May 2020), with lots including an 8-page letter written by Claude Monet to his second wife, Alice, in 1901.  It comments on the arrangements for Queen Victoria's funeral and Monet's meeting with writer Henry James.


      #### Jan-April 2020


      In February 2020, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts marked its 150th anniversary.  It selected 15 key works for the occasion, including one of Monet's Haystacks (or Grainstacks).
