      ### If you're in a hurry, here are the key facts you need to know about
      Olympia.


      #### Number 1


      It was painted by Edouard Manet in 1863, inspired by Titian's The Venus of Urbino, and submitted to the Annual Exhibition (Salon) of France's Fine Arts Academy (Academie des Beaux Arts).


      #### Number 2


      The painting shows a high-class prostitute called Olympia (painted using Manet's model Victorine Meurent) staring brazenly at the viewer.  Olympia's maid is handing her a bunch of flowers, presumably from a satisfied customer, and there is a black cat with his tail extended on the far right.


      #### Number 3


      The public reacted angrily to the painting.  They saw it as a crass depiction of an uncomfortable subject (prostitution was rife in 19th century Paris).  The painting had to be moved after attempts were made to slash it with canes.


      #### Number 4


      The critics were incredibly harsh.  One called Olympia a "female gorilla".  Another said that Manet had produced a work of "perfect ugliness".  Manet was so horrified by the reaction that he fled to Spain to escape.


      #### Number 5


      The painting went unsold in Manet's lifetime.  In 1890, Monet organised a collection to buy it for the French state from Manet's widow, Suzanne, raising 20,000 francs.  But the painting was not hung in the Louvre for another 17 years.  It is now found in the Musee D'Orsay.

      ### Inspired by Titian, Manet knew that he was playing with fire when he
      painted Olympia.


      #### The Venus of Urbino


      Manet’s composition plays on the famous Renaissance painting ‘The Venus of Urbino’ by Titian. Titian’s work depicts Venus, the goddess of love, painted both as an erotic figure but also as a symbol of marital fidelity. 


      ![Manet's Olympia](/assets/10-paintings-manet-olympia.jpg "Manet's Olympia")


      ![Titian's The Venus of Urbino inspired Manet's Olympia](/assets/titian-venus-of-urbino.jpg "Titian's The Venus of Urbino inspired Manet's Olympia")


      The dog at the foot of the bed, the roses in her hand, the servant in the background looking down at the child and the myrtle on the windowsill all serve as symbols, representing marital values such as licit love, faithfulness and motherhood. 


      In Manet’s painting, these symbols are turned on their head. The eroticism he presents could not be further from marital fidelity. Instead, it is rooted in lust, lasciviousness and prostitution. Olympia stares out at the viewer, the dog is replaced by a black cat with its tail standing upright and its back arched, a symbol of sexuality. 


      #### The scene


      Olympia lies on a fringed bedspread, her fingers playing with one end. This has been linked to an allusion to the model’s pubic hair. The slippers on the model’s feet, partly falling off, may also refer to the term ‘chausson’ (slipper) which also meant an “old prostitute”. The phrase “putain comme chausson” means “whore like a slipper”. In contrast, Venus’ feet are bare and shapely, positioned demurely on the couch.


      The flowers in the scene also contribute to the overt sexuality in Manet’s painting. In the scene, Olympia is being presented with an open bouquet of flowers, another sexual symbol, wrapped in cheap newspaper rather than rooted in a pot. 


      ![A watercolour study Manet produced for Olympia](/assets/manet-watercolour-olympia-1863.jpg "A watercolour study Manet produced for Olympia")


      Tucked behind her ear is what is thought to be an oversized hibiscus flower. This flower has been associated with sexuality thanks to its large protruding pistil and its reputation for transience. It may also have marked Olympia out to be a creole woman, which at this time held the stereotype of passion and sensuality.


      #### Olympia's maid


      Whilst critiques have often tended to focus on Olympia herself, it is also important to pick out the other character in the painting. 


      The black woman standing over Olympia acts as another symbol, bringing the sexuality of the scene to the fore. She offers Olympia a bouquet of flowers, likely from a lover who is waiting just outside the scene. According to Sander Gilman, during the 19th century the image of a black woman in art was a convention for representing unbounded sexuality.


      ![Olympia's Maid](/assets/manet-olympia-maid.jpg "Olympia's Maid")


      At the same time, the figure of Olympia’s servant disappears somewhat into the background. Manet’s light effects deliberately obscure her face, making her presence almost a suggestion. In contrast, the flowers are lit brightly, forcing them into the centre of attention like Olympia herself.


      More recently, the painting was renamed ‘Laure’ by the Musée d’Orsay in recognition of the black model who also appears in the painting with Meurent. The 2019 exhibition sought to bring attention to the figures who have been ignored in art history. Indeed, Laure has often been missing from analyses of the work.


      #### Lighting


      It’s important to also note the unnatural lighting Manet uses in the scene. Olympia’s face is lit up as though by a spotlight whilst the background is shadowy. Similarly, her face, neck and the flower in her hair are fully illuminated but the rest of her hair and body is not.


      In manipulating the lighting in such a way, Manet was able to draw attention to a few key features in the painting. Namely, Olympia’s face and particularly her gaze are the most highlighted parts of the painting. The eye is drawn there first.


      In doing so, Manet centres the viewer’s gaze on the ambiguous expression of his nude, rather than on her poise or the forms of her body. 


      As Lisa Moore summarised in 1989: 


      > “Olympia seems to have two faces: the hard-edged, businesslike, hairless one, and the much more easily recognizable 'feminine' one framed by the fall of hair. 'Neither face is ever quite suppressed by the other, nor can they be made into aspects of the same image, the same imaginary whole.' Orders of signs thus interfere with one another in this painting, disrupting the function of the nude as a comforting \[…] containment of three-dimensional reality.”

    text: >-
      ### Manet’s Olympia was exhibited in the Paris Salon of May 1865. 


      The reaction to the painting was unprecedented. Press and critics instantly took against the work with cries like “Such indecency!” and contempt at the model’s “vicious strangeness”.§


      #### Hostility


      Perhaps one of the most extreme reactions and the most quoted was a piece published in Le Grand Journal by a rather unknown writer named Amédée Cantaloube:


      > “Never, moreover, had anyone seen with his own eyes a similar spectacle with a more cynical effect: this Olympia, a kind of female gorilla, a grotesque in rubber outlined in black, apes on a bed, in a state of complete nudity, the horizontal attitude of Titian’s Venus: the right arm rests on the body in the same fashion, except for the hand, which is flexed in a sort of shameless contraction.”


      This reaction echoed another review published in Les Tablettes de Pierrot describing, 


      > “a woman on a bed, or, rather some sort of form bloated like a grotesque in rubber; a kind of African monkey \[guenon] making fun of the pose and the movement of the arm in Titian’s Venus, with one hand shamelessly flexed.”


      Félix Deriège in Le Siècle stated, “She does not have a human form. Mr. Manet has so pulled her out of joint that she could not possibly move her arms or legs”. 


      Jules Claretie also asked, “What is this odalisque with the yellow chest, an ignoble model picked up who knows where and who has the pretension to represent Olympia?”


      #### An uncomfortable truth?


      Art historians have since linked adjectives such as ‘grotesque’, ‘monstrous’, ‘vulgar’ and ‘hideous’ to Olympia’s overt role as a prostitute, which the Parisian public were unable to refer to freely in polite society. As a result, they used exaggerated phrases to highlight their discomfort at seeing a prostitute in such a setting.


      At the same time, Anne McCauley has also suggested that these reactions are linked to descriptions of primates that had become part of public knowledge during the latter half of the 19th century. 


      In identifying Olympia as such, reviewers and critics were revealing their fears around what distinguishes humans from primates. Olympia’s ambiguous hand positions and uncontrollable sexuality brought her closer to a ‘gorilla’ than a bourgeois woman. 


      #### A link to Darwin?


      McCauley also references the anxiety around the publication of [Darwin’s On the Origin of Species](https://greatestbritons.com/charles-darwin-biography/#3) in 1859 and the rise in popularity of travelling exhibitions showing humans who were said to be the “missing links”. 


      Indeed, Victor Fournel, writing in La Gazette de France described his experience of viewing Manet’s painting as like going to a fair, where 


      > “a distinguished monsieur offers you, with elegant language, marvels that are extraordinary, incomparable, and unique, and then, as soon as you go inside, people show you a two-headed calf, one of which is cardboard.”


      #### Humour


      As well as confusion and outrage, the painting also prompted laughter. Some viewers even suggested that the work was a joke or was painted as a publicity stunt. There was a belief that Manet may have painted his strangely proportioned nude to try and draw a crowd.


      Despite the outraged reactions of the crowd, it is also possible to see through the feigned horror that the critics portrayed. Whilst viewers may have been shocked by the immorality of the painting on display, many of the male attendees would also have had relationships with prostitutes, likely on a regular basis. 


      Many more would have viewed nude photos, visited brothels and purchased early pornographic images. As Charles Baudelaire pointed out in reference to another Salon work in 1859 that caused a similar stir, the prudishness of the public was nothing more than a front.


      Amazingly, there were attempts to destroy the work by viewers using umbrellas and walking sticks. As a result, the Salon organisers were forced to move the painting higher up so that it was out of reach and out of harm’s way, as well as employing guards for the painting. This was perhaps one of the strongest reactions to a work of art in modern history.

### One of the most enduring and intriguing paintings from the impressionist movement, Manet’s Olympia from 1863 has been the subject of constant analysis since it was first painted.

Sparking heated debate, revisionist critiques and countless books, popular interest in the artwork has continued for over a century.

What makes the painting so interesting, today and when it was first exhibited, is the central figure of Olympia. Depicted lying on a chaise, her head turned rigidly to face the viewer, Olympia’s gaze stares out boldly from the painting. 

This stare has been the subject of much questioning, prompting people to ask: 

> "Who is she? Where is she from? and What does she want?"

In Olympia, Manet painted a female figure with agency. She is nude and some would say, classically beautiful (though many others disagreed) but she is also much more. 

She is a strong character who questions the viewer and interrogates our look by returning it with a look of her own. It is arguably this factor that has made the painting so popular for so long.

Read on for more details about how Manet came to paint Olympia, what the reaction was to the painting when it was first unveiled and how it helped to shape the Impressionist movement.
